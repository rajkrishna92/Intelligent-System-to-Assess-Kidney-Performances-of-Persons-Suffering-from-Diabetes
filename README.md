## Abstract
Diabetes is the leading cause of many covert diseases, and kidney disease is one of them. For diabetic patients, the prediction of the kidney performance in progressions over time is crucial because reducing the cause of End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) and increasing the mortality rates. This study develops a qualitative-based linguistic decision-making algorithm for predicting the various stages of kidney performance and the chances of the corresponding stage. Concerning various literature surveys, it takes mainly 11 input risk factors for a diabetic patient and converts these input factors as fuzzy variables using the fuzzy combination approach, to develop the proposed algorithm. It has been observed that our model's prediction is near correct with doctors' predictions by applying the real-life data from nearby health centers. The proposed algorithm can be used to develop a digital system (i.e. remote medicine) for rural areas where medical experts are not available properly.
